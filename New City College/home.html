            <h1>Covid 19</h1>
            <p class="para"> The protection of children and educational facilities is particularly
                 important.<br> Precautions are necessary to prevent the potential spread of COVID-19 in school settings.<br>
                  However, care must also be taken to avoid stigmatizing students and staff <br>
                  who may have been exposed to the virus. COVID-19 does not differentiate among borders, 
                  ethnicities, disability status, age or gender.<br> Education settings should continue to be welcoming, 
                  respectful, inclusive and supportive environments to all.<br>
                   Measures taken by schools can prevent the entry and spread of COVID-19 by students and staff who may have 
                   been exposed to the virus,<br> 
                while minimizing disruption and protecting students and staff from discrimination.
              <br>
                <br> DISADVANTAGES<br>
              <br>
                Even if COVID-19 does not seem to affect children severely,<br> 
                many pediatrics wards have been focused more on the emergency of COVID-19-related issues. <br>
                For this reason, attention on many other acute and chronic diseases, especially those rarer, may be lacking. <br>
                This scarcity of interest may cause, particularly in childhood, severe problems or even death. <br>
                Politicians and physicians may be distracted by COVID-19-related issues, but also parents or even the same young patients,<br> 
                as these last’s attention may be focused only on news and information related to COVID-19,<br>
                 misunderstanding some symptoms or paying less attention to their (chronic) diseases.
